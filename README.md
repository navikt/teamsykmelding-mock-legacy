### Install all the dependencies

### Access to GitHub Package Registry

Since we use dependencies inherent in GPR,
then one must set up access to the GPR with a PAT (personal access token)
which has `read:packages`.
You can [create PAT here](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
If you have a PAT that you use to access maven packages in GitHub, you can reuse this.
In your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`, set the following environment variable:

`export NPM_AUTH_TOKEN=<your PAT with read:packages>`

```bash
yarn
```

### Run the app in development mode

```bash
yarn start
```

### Builds the app for production

```bash
yarn build
```

Open http://localhost:3000/ to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
